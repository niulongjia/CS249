    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is for you to develop models for the <a href=\"http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/diamonds.html\"><b>diamonds</b> dataset</a>,\n",
    "which is included in the <a href=\"http://ggplot2.org\">ggplot2</a> package.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple assignment:  you are asked to build four models:\n",
    "LDA or QDA, simple Linear Regression, log-scaled Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression.\n",
    "You then just upload the formulas (R commands) you used to construct these models to CCLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"border-width:20px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0:  build the numeric.diamonds dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes commands for buiding a dataset called `<code>numeric.diamonds</code>\n",
    "that you are to use for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The diamonds dataset has 3 categorical attributes (cut, color, clarity)\n",
    "that are <b>ordered</b>.\n",
    "<i>\n",
    "The <tt>numeric.diamonds</tt> dataset \n",
    "is a numeric version of the diamonds dataset\n",
    "in which all these categorical attributes are converted to integer codes.\n",
    "</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there are 7 colors, with the ordering: J < I < H < G < F < E < D (J is worst, D is best).\n",
    "We implement these by replacing J with the value 1,\n",
    "I with the value 2, ..., and D with the value 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this transformation for cut and clarity also,\n",
    "the result is an entirely numeric dataset called <tt>numeric.diamonds</tt>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this notebook, we've provided another called <tt>Diamonds.ipynb</tt> for gaining intuition\n",
    "about the data by walking through some exploratory graphics.\n",
    "Many aspects of the dataset are displayed.\n",
    "You do not have to use this notebook, it is totally optional, but it is included\n",
    "since visualization can help.\n",
    "\n",

    "       sample.size = 0.75 * n   ###### Use 75% of the data for the training set\n",

    "       my.training.set = numeric.diamonds[  training.row.ids, ]\n",
    "       my.test.set     = numeric.diamonds[ -training.row.ids, ]   # set complement of training.set.ids\n",
    "</code>\n",

    "<b>\n",

    "The grading program will re-compute your model and its accuracy using this method.\n",

    "### Step 2: compute accuracy of 4 Baseline Models about diamonds\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"border-width:20px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: build four models about diamonds\n",
    "\n",
    "For the numeric.diamonds dataset you are to develop a notebook that builds four models in R:\n",
    "<ol><li>\n",
    "a LDA or QDA classification model that predicts a diamond's <b>Cut</b>.\n",
    "</li><li>\n",
    "a linear regression model that predicts a diamond's <b>Price</b>.\n",
    "</li><li>\n",
    "a linear regression model that predicts a diamond's <b>log10(Price)</b>.\n",
    "</li><li>\n",
    "a logistic regression model that predicts whether a diamond's <b>Price is above &dollar;1500</b>.\n",
    "</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, you might produce these models:\n",
    "<ol><li>\n",
    "<code>  qda( cut ~ price + table + color + clarity,       data=my.training.set )</code>\n",
    "</li><li>\n",
    "<code>  lm(  price ~ carat + x + y + z + clarity,         data=my.training.set )</code>\n",

    "<code>  lm(  log10(price) ~ table + log10(carat) + color, data=my.training.set )</code>\n",
    "</li><li>\n",
    "<code>  glm( I(price>1500) ~ carat + table + clarity,     data=my.training.set, family = binomial )</code>\n",
    "</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "As these examples show, details matter:\n",
    "<b>you must specify the complete formula for each model in detail, listing all variables included.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Please choose attributes that produce the most accuracy models you can.\n",
    "More accurate models will get a higher score; see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"border-width:20px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: generate a CSV file \"HW3_output.csv\" including your 4 models\n",
    "\n",
    "If these were your four models, then to complete the assignment you would create\n",
    "a CSV file <tt>HW3_output.csv</tt> containing eight lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",

    "There is no length restriction on the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"border-width:20px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: upload your CSV file and notebook to CCLE\n",

    "To produce a logistic regression model, you must include the option <tt>family=binomial</tt>, or equivalently <tt>family=binomial(\"logit\")</tt>.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you have complete control over which variables are used in your model,\n",
    "and over which transformations you apply to the variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "### \"Accuracy\" is a standard measure of performance for models\n",
    "\n",
    "For LDA and QDA, and for logistic regression,\n",
    "the accuracy measure is the percentage of correct classifications.\n",
    "For linear regressions a standard measure is $R^2$.\n",
    "You must implement these measures as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The grading program will compare your model's accuracy against a baseline model, using your data\n",

    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the four baseline models, you must do two things:\n",
    "<ol><li>\n",
    "(18 points):  compute the accuracy of the baseline model.\n",
    "</li><li>\n",
    "(7 points):  find a model that has higher accuracy than the baseline model.\n",
    "</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not difficult to get 4 &ast; 18 = 72 points on this assignment.\n",
    "However, 4 models that are better than the baseline will give 4 &ast; 25 = 100 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### After grading, we will produce a list of models designed by the class\n",
    "\n",
    "Since accuracy of the models is part of the HW score, make the models as accurate as you can.\n",
    "Some of your score on this assignment will depend on the accuracy of your models.\n",
    "All models will be compiled into a list and distributed at the end, so everyone can see the models\n",
