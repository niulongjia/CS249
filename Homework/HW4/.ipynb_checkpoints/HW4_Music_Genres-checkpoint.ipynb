    "# HW4 Problem:  Classifying Music Genres\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem asks you to classify music into genres that include:  Blues, Classical, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Rock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column 192 in the dataset is the \"GENRE\" attribute used for classification.\n",
    "The 191 columns before this are numeric features of music clips.\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "A database of 60 music performers has been prepared for the competition. The material is divided into six categories: classical music, jazz, blues, pop, rock and heavy metal. For each of the performers 15-20 music pieces have been collected. All music pieces are partitioned into 20 segments and parameterized. The descriptors used in parametrization also those formulated within the MPEG-7 standard, are only listed here since they have already been thoroughly reviewed and explained in many studies.  <br /><br />The feature vector consists of 191 parameters, the first 127 parameters are based on the MPEG-7 standard, the remaining ones are cepstral coefficients descriptors and time-related dedicated parameters:<br /><br />a) parameter 1: Temporal Centroid, <br />b) parameter 2: Spectral Centroid average value, <br />c) parameter 3: Spectral Centroid variance, <br />d) parameters 4-37: Audio Spectrum Envelope (ASE)  average values in 34 frequency bands<br />e) parameter 38: ASE average value (averaged for all frequency bands)<br />f) parameters 39-72: ASE variance values in 34 frequency bands<br />g) parameter 73: averaged ASE variance parameters<br />h) parameters 74,75: Audio Spectrum Centroid -- average and variance values<br />i) parameters 76,77: Audio Spectrum Spread -- average and variance values<br />j) parameters 78-101: Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) average values for 24 frequency bands<br />k) parameter 102: SFM average value (averaged for all frequency bands)<br />l) parameters 103-126: Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) variance values for 24 frequency bands<br />m) parameter 127: averaged SFM variance parameters<br />n) parameters 128-147: 20 first mel cepstral coefficients average values <br />o) parameters 148-167: the same as 128-147<br />p) parameters 168-191: dedicated parameters in time domain based of the analysis of the distribution of the envelope in relation to the rms value.<br />\n",
