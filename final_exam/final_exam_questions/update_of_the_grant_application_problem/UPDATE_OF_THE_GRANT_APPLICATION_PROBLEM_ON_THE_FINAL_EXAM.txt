The Grant Application problem on the Final Exam asked for you to predict
the success of Grant Applications  --- optionally using the knowledge
in the [APM] text --- and upload your predictions on Kaggle.com.

UNFORTUNATELY, Kaggle no longer permits upload of predictions for this dataset.

AS A RESULT, we are giving you two choices:

(1)  you can go ahead and just upload your Grant success predictions
     to CCLE (ignoring Kaggle.com).
     [However:  see the important notices below.]

(2)  you can enter another competition on Kaggle.com ---
     any one that ends before 5pm next Monday.
     (In other words, if you enter another competition,
     you can ignore the Grant Application problem).

  There are two Kaggle competitions that end before 5pm Monday:

  -- Kobe Bryant shot selection    -- ends Monday June 13
        (https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection)
  -- Expedia hotel booking         -- ends Friday June 10
        (https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations)

  For either competition, you must also upload your predictions file
  (and results from Kaggle) to CCLE.

Since the Kobe Bryant contest ends at 11:59 pm UTC, Monday 13 June 2016
(which is 4:59pm our time), the exam deadline will be 5pm Monday June 13.

In other words the deadline for the CS249 Final Exam is now 5pm Monday.
Please choose one of the options above.

      IMPORTANT!   UPDATE ON THE GRANT APPLICATION PROBLEM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you choose to continue with the Grant predictions data:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  WE WILL BE USING "AUC" TO EVALUATE PREDICTIONS FOR THIS DATASET,
    SINCE BOTH KAGGLE AND [APM] USE IT.

    -- FOR [APM], SEE:  Chapter 11 (which describes AUC), and Ch 12.
    -- FOR KAGGLE:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/unimelb/details/Evaluation

    SO: YOUR PREDICTIONS SHOULD BE _PROBABILITIES_ INSTEAD OF 0/1 VALUES.

    In R, probabilities can be obtained from the "predict" function:

      glm_predictions = predict.glm( glm_model,  X, type = "response" )
      svm_predictions = predict.svm( svm_model,  X, probabilities = TRUE )

    With the caret package, this is done inside the "train" function:

      my_model = train(X, y, method = "whatever", ...,  metric = "ROC”, … )
      my_predictions = my_model$pred

    ‘metric = "ROC”’  causes train() to produce probabilities.


2.  You will benefit from reading Chs 12-14 in [APM],
    which cover quirks of the Grants dataset.
    For example, the grant applications in 2005-2006 are not
    good predictors of grants after 2007.
    So the [APM] book avoids using grants from 2005 and 2006.

    Also, the [APM] book helps to transform the original data
    into a form that permits analysis. The script  "CreateGrantData.R"
    in the grants/extra_materials/  directory shows how to extract
    many useful features.  Basically "CreateGrantData.R" proprocesses
    the Grant Application data into two tables  (see Section 12.1, p.282):

    --  training   (training data used in [APM] for tuning and final model)
    --  testing    ("test" data used throughout [APM] for various purposes)

       > ###  inspect the Grant Data analyzed in [APM]
       > load('grantData.RData')
       > dim(training)
       [1] 8190 1882
       > dim(testing)
       [1]  518 1882

    The original unimelb_training.csv dataset has 252 features,
    while the trnsformed [APM] "training" table has 1882 features .
    For more information see "CreateGrantData.R".

3.  With this in mind, we will let you use the [APM]-extracted data
    instead of the original dataset.

    Earlier the Final Exam asked you to use the datasets

      unimelb_training.csv     -- the Kaggle training dataset
      unimelb_test.csv         -- the Kaggle prediction input dataset

    This is still permitted, of course.  However, since the [APM] has more
    descriptive features, we are permitting you to instead use these datasets:

      APM_training.csv         -- the 'training' dataset in the [APM] book
      APM_testing.csv          -- the 'testing'  dataset in the [APM] book
      APM_prediction_input.csv -- prediction input dataset for the Final Exam.

    Either is fine, but the APM_training.csv and APM_testing.csv 
    data should give better results (since they have many useful features).
    In case it helps, 'grantData.RData' used in [APM] Chs 12-18 is also included.

    Please upload your predictions from "APM_prediction_input.csv" to CCLE.
